<p style="color:white;">Welcome to the Blog. This blog just goes over the whole entire month at a glance.</br>May 2024</br>So, school has been a nightmare due to testing, since we've had four tests already(fifty questions each at that) and we have two more test to go. But, I've gotten two golden Pok'emon cards, so yipee. I also have gotten excited for the new Oynx Storm, even though it's supposed to be coming out in January of 2025. Pretty far out. Also, I may or may not update the blog for a while, because I won't have a way to work on it effeciently, no laptop, no website shanagans :[. Anyway, this is a long rant, and I don't think I'm done yet. Plans for the website are, more links to cool websites, better blogs, holdiday content, and to be hit with soccer balls less. Also, the christmas content is being worked on, so there should be a christmas update to the website, even though I'll have to use my phone to code, so oof for me.</br>Okay, so now it's May 9, the nightmare of waiting after testing is finally over. I'm so happy that it's finally over, feeling my as well since we don't have to do an assignment in Science Period since we just had testing for science. I'm not sure what else to put here, since I'm not sure how to do blogging, I guess I should just talk about what I feel. I might do blogs on the days I feel like I should write here. Also, chromebooks are getting taken back in eight days, so I might just not write too much, since I'd have to type it out on my phone.</p>
