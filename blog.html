<h1 style="color:white;">Why, Hello there.</h1>
<p style="color:white;">Welcome to...</br>this.</br>Anyway, I making this site for giggles and maybe making it slightly useful. So, what I'm saying is that I may or may not put stories, "how may times I get hit with a ball in gym class" counter, or random images of my child(My child is a doggy).</br>So, keep this in the back of your head, maybe it'll be cool later(A.K.A when I learn to use HTML for real).</p>
