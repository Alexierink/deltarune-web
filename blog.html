<p style="color:white;">Welcome to the May Blog. This blog just goes over the whole entire month at a glance.</br>So, school has been a nightmare due to testing, since we've had four tests already(fifty questions each at that) and we have two more test to go. But, I've gotten two golden Pok'emon cards, so yipee. I also.</p>
